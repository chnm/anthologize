Use the power of WordPress to transform your content into a book.

== Description ==

Anthologize is a free, open-source, WordPress-based platform for publishing. Grab posts from your WordPress blog, pull in feeds from external sites, or create new content directly in Anthologize. Then outline, order, and edit your work, crafting it into a coherent volume for export in several ebook formats, including PDF, EPUB, and TEI.

Visit [anthologize.org](http://anthologize.org/ "Anthologize") to learn more about Anthologize.

== Installation ==

The best way to install Anthologize is via the Add New link under Dashboard > Plugins.

To install Anthologize manually, follow these steps.

1. Upload the `anthologize` directory to `/wp-content/plugins/`
1. Make sure the `/anthologize/templates/epub/temp/` directory is writable by the server
1. Activate Anthologize through the WordPres 'Plugins' menu
1. Visit Dashboard > Anthologize to start compiling your project

If you're upgrading manually from a previous version of Anthologize, please be sure to deactivate your existing plugin before replacing it with the new files, and reactivate after uploading.

== Usage ==

Many optimizations to the PDF export have been added, but resource limits on the server will always be a potential issue. Here are some tips to try if you encounter errors or white screens of death while exporting PDF:

1. Include page breaks between parts and items. This appears to reduce the memory that the PDF classes (TCPDF) require.
2. Change the following information in the php.ini file in the Resource Limits section. On most hosted servers, this file is in the top web directory and/or in your WordPress directory. If there is one in your WordPress directory, edit that one. If you have questions, please contact your web hosting provider.

Change the max_execution_time setting:
max_execution_time = 180;

Change the memory_limit setting:
memory_limit = 128M;


The latest release of PHP has a default memory limit of 128M, but this might not be in place on your server. Increasing the execution time (measured in seconds) can also help.
In a hosted server environment, increasing the resources Anthologize consumes could hurt performance for everyone else on your server. It might be worth consulting your hosting company before increasing these resource limits and exporting projects on a regular basis.

Cover images in ePub output.

To add your own cover images, just upload them to the anthologize/templates/epub/covers directory and they will appear as options in the export screen. Make sure they are readable by the server.
